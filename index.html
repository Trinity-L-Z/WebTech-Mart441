  <h2>Cool stuff about me!</h2>

<blockquote>"The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain." </blockquote>

  <h3>What does Trinity love to do?</h3>
  
  <p>The real question we should be asking is, what DON'T I love? I am a true explorer, always evolving and daring to test new ideas. Primarily, I have always loved reading, video games, and cinema. I love to paint and draw--it runs in my family!--and am currently endevouring to sell beaded jewelry. But don't be fooled by my cozy hobbies! I am an outdoor enthusiast, a lover of bouldering and yoga, and live for swimming in the summer.</p>

  <h3>Inspiration & Ambitions</h3>
  <p>The majority of my inspiration comes from the natural world. I am also the first in my family to pursue a bachelor's degree, let alone one in art! It was my grandma's dream to be an animator, and my mom's to be an artist. Now, here I am with one semester left in the Media Arts program. </p>
  <p>I call myself a storyteller. I believe the stories I have to tell are important, and this urge has driven me to pick up various skills in order to properly express myself. The dream is to work on animated movies and TV shows in some capacity with a team of people who share the same values as I do. But things like that take time!</p>

  <h3>Memory</h3>
  <p>While I grew up in a poor household, my mom still managed to make sure we had a WII. My sisters and I loved to play Super Mario Bros; now that I live at home again, I have picked up Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with my 9 year old sister. We typically take turns by switching whenever one of us dies. She is also much braver than me when it comes to combat! I think that games have long-term impact on the world, some for better and some for worse. Just like movies and books, they are stories we can interact with and learn from; however, given how I feel about the current political climate, I feel that games are insuficient for solving the most pressing issues we face.</p>
