I had never used ChatGPT before, since I have very strong feelings against it. I created a website including an image of my cat, while the gen AI stuck to the prompts and perhaps made the function of the code in its presentation on the website more clear.

I would feel really gross if I realied only on AI-generated output, but I have no qualms relying on other's work so long as credit is given. In the former case, I feel that my participation in the project/experience is irrelevant.

I could explain the code I wrote for this assignment, which stuck to very basic structuring. The JavaScript stuff is still a little bit of a grey area, but I will gain confidence with practice. The code GenAI wrote included mostly the same things.

The response Gen AI does not feel like my own, since I played no role in its creation outside of entering the assignment into the text box.
