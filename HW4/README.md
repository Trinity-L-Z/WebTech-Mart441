I wish I had gotten to this assignment sooner, so I am submitting what I have now. I found creating this choose-your-own adventure assignment to be much more challenging than anticipated, specifically the function within my js file aspect. I don't understand how to change the photo and button text with the onclick event in order to keep everything on a single page.

One thing I noticed, AI used "let" outside of the function in the js file rather than "var" within the function which is shown in the sample provided for this assignment.

Since you don't take late work, I figured I could get at least some points and figure out a time I could meet with you to talk about how this assignment is mean to be completed.
