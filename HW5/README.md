AI used a lot more functions than me and created a fantasy-inspired story. It was very in-depth, especially compared to my Bad-Bunny-at-the-Super-Bowl plot. A lot of what has gone into the last two assignments has definitely left me confused, and keeping my story simple allowed me to focus on the assignment without getting disctracted by my imagination. I guess AI doesn't have to worry about that!
