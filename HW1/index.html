<blockquote>"The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain." </blockquote>

  <h3>What does Trinity love to do?</h3>
  
  <p>The real question we should be asking is, what DON'T I love? I am a true explorer, always evolving and daring to test new ideas. Primarily, I have always loved reading, video games, and cinema. I love to paint and draw--it runs in my family!--and am currently endevouring to sell beaded jewelry. But don't be fooled by my cozy hobbies! I am an outdoor enthusiast, a lover of bouldering and yoga, and live for swimming in the summer.</p>
