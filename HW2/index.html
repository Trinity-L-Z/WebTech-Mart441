  <h3>Baby Boy</h3>
  <img src="babyboy.jpg" alt="Link as a baby!"
  <p>This image was taken almost four years ago! I can't believe how old he is already.</p>

  <h3>Inspiration & Ambitions</h3>
  <p>The majority of my inspiration comes from the natural world. I am also the first in my family to pursue a bachelor's degree, let alone one in art! It was my grandma's dream to be an animator, and my mom's to be an artist. Now, here I am with one semester left in the Media Arts program. </p>
  <p>I call myself a storyteller. I believe the stories I have to tell are important, and this urge has driven me to pick up various skills in order to properly express myself. The dream is to work on animated movies and TV shows in some capacity with a team of people who share the same values as I do. But things like that take time!</p>
 


  <h3>Memory</h3>
  <p>While I grew up in a poor household, my mom still managed to make sure we had a WII. My sisters and I loved to play Super Mario Bros; now that I live at home again, I have picked up Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with my 9 year old sister. We typically take turns by switching whenever one of us dies. She is also much braver than me when it comes to combat! I think that games have long-term impact on the world, some for better and some for worse. Just like movies and books, they are stories we can interact with and learn from; however, given how I feel about the current political climate, I feel that games are insuficient for solving the most pressing issues we face.</p>
