  <h3>Memory</h3>
  <p>While I grew up in a poor household, my mom still managed to make sure we had a WII. My sisters and I loved to play Super Mario Bros; now that I live at home again, I have picked up Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with my 9 year old sister. We typically take turns by switching whenever one of us dies. She is also much braver than me when it comes to combat! I think that games have long-term impact on the world, some for better and some for worse. Just like movies and books, they are stories we can interact with and learn from; however, given how I feel about the current political climate, I feel that games are insuficient for solving the most pressing issues we face.</p>
